Condo was super clean, luxurious, just the way it was in the photos. It was a very comfortable stay.  I was in Toronto for business and this place was everything I was looking for. Only thing that bothered me Frank required the place to be throughly clean, ready for next guest. I would never trash an apartment I am renting and of course I did my very best to leave it as clean as possible but I was stressed if I'd have enough time for cleaning.

Similarly we were promised a receipt at the start of the stay and I had to request one via email more than once after we left.  Most frustrating was that we chose the suite because it listed \"\"parking included\"\" in the amenities.  The description',\n",
       " \"The location is great, as a subway station is literally next door, and you can walk along bloor and next to starbucks and restaurants etc. The apartment itself is very basic but very comfortable too, if you are looking for somewhere to cook, then you shouldn't stay here since there were like 3 plates and pots, but I didn't mind buying food everyday. When we first got there the place was missing towels, but we asked him to provide more towels etc etc and he immediately did so and dropped off toilet paper and soap. My only problem with the place was that the air conditioner didn't work, he told us since the first day someone would come fix it, and that while we were out he said someone did come to fix it, but trust me it wasn't fixed... the air was very still and hot. But overall the place is good if your looking for somewhere convenient to stay! And the sheets were nice and soft! (not as bad as what other ppl said)\",\n",

And there's a Bixie Bike station right across Yonge St. from the building!  The apartment is nice...clean and quiet with a great view.  I really appreciate how accommodating both Sam and his friend, Mark, are.

I may have rushed the host a bit, though we did agree to meet at 4pm, which is when we met to exchange the key.  Perhaps he was running a bit behind schedule and didn't get a chance to do as thorough a cleaning as he usually would do?  When I turned the key back over to the host, I mentioned the bathroom, and he said he wished I had told him about it on the first day and he would've taken care of it.

It features three bedrooms but one of them is very small and only has a toddler bed, but can accommodate an inflatable mattress and our hostess provided a couple.

We used the large salt water pool both nights we were there. On one side of the pool is a view of the lake, the other side has a view of the city which is similar to the view from the guest room...awesome! My wife and I really enjoyed the late night swims (pool is open 24 hours). The subway is about a 10 minute walk from the condo, which can bring you all over town. And for those that use cabs, you can fetch a cab in front of the building with no problem. Most hotels charge $20-$35 a day just for parking, and parking is FREE when you stay with Larry and Kathie.

The apartment was extremely hot and had a musky smell to it.  About 90% of our showers involved standing there while there was no pressure to then go freezing to then boiling hot and then finally to a bearable temperature. This usually happened while we were standing there covered in soap.<br/>They share their Wifi with other people in the building and therefore can be quite slow or non-existent. <br/>The location is good in terms of public transport - there are trams and buses that go past quite regularly. Liberty Village was our second home. We spent a lot of time there - it's very modern with a lot of cafes, bars, pubs, supermarket, banks etc.<br/>I would recommend this place for a short stay, no more than 3 nights.

We ended up spending the night on the couch.<br/><br/>2) The toilet seat was also dirty, as a brown layer of dirt came off when we wiped it clean.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it was not the worst stay, but was also not the best.',\n",

There is also a lot of storage and closet space. A huge window, overlooking the fountain (albeit under construction at the moment), seems to add even more space to the apartment.

I never saw Nick or Nena, but they were perfectly attentive over email, and I had everything I needed.  It was kind of nice having everything ready and just coming and going on my own. <br/><br/>More of a temporary apartment than a classic Airbnb experience, so if you're into the social aspect of Airbnb this might not be your thing. But if you want to feel like you've got your own place in the city for a few days, this is perfect.<br/><br/>I was especially impressed with how well furnished the apartment was and how well equipped the kitchen was.  I cook a lot and didn't find anything I needed that wasn't there.  The space is a little cozy but it's laid out well and everything is  in good repair.<br/><br/>The location is a little specific.  I came here to be near the Beaches area so this was perfect, but if you are going to spend a lot if time on the west side of the city or downtown, you might find it a little difficult to quickly get around by mass transit, particularly at night.  It's very near a bus that gets you to the subway but it's a little infrequent.

However, in all honesty, with such a helpful and descriptive manual, there weren't too many queries to have. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is beautiful with everything you could need - a small kitchenette, a large table with chairs and a spacious open plan living space with high ceilings and lots of natural light.

The apartment was clean, not immaculate, but certainly well taken care of and ideal for our short 2-night stay. The location is great within Yorkville with fantastic restaurants and shopping nearby as well as the subway, grocery, and Starbucks across the street. The apartment is well-amenitized with basic cable, speedy wireless internet, and a washer/dryer (although we didn't use it).
